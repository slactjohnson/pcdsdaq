    The LCLS1 daq as a ``bluesky``-compatible object.

    This uses the ``pydaq`` module to connect with a running daq instance,

    It can be used as a ``Reader`` in a ``bluesky`` plan to take data at
    discrete scan points.

        Changes the daq's configuration for the next run.

        This is the method that directly interfaces with the daq. If you simply
        want to get a configuration ready for later, use `preconfig`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        events: ``int``, optional
            If provided, the daq will run for this many events before
            stopping, unless we override in `begin`.
            If not provided, we'll use the ``duration`` argument instead.

        duration: ``int``, optional
            If provided, the daq will run for this many seconds before
            stopping, unless we override in `begin`.
            If not provided, and ``events`` was also not provided, an empty
            call like ``begin()`` will run indefinitely.

        record: ``bool``, optional
            If ``True``, we'll record the data. Otherwise, we'll run without
            recording. Defaults to ``False``, or the last set value for
            ``record``.

        use_l3t: ``bool``, optional
            If ``True``, an ``events`` argument to begin will be reinterpreted
            to only count events that pass the level 3 trigger. Defaults to
            its last configured value, or ``False``.

        controls: ``dict{name: device}`` or ``list[device...]``, optional
            If provided, values from these will make it into the DAQ data
            stream as variables. We will check ``device.position`` and
            ``device.value`` for quantities to use and we will update these
            values each time begin is called. To provide a list, all devices
            must have a ``name`` attribute.
