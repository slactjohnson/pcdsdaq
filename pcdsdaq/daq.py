    The LCLS1 daq as a ``bluesky``-compatible object.

    This uses the ``pydaq`` module to connect with a running daq instance,
    controlling it via socket commands.

    It can be used as a ``Reader`` in a ``bluesky`` plan to take data at
    discrete scan points.

    at the beginning of the run and end at the end of the run.

        record: ``bool``, optional

        use_l3t: ``bool``, optional

            values each time begin is called. To provide a list, all devices
            must have a ``name`` attribute.

        wait: ``bool``, optional
            If ``True``, wait for the daq to finish aquiring data. A
            ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (``ctrl+c``) during this wait will end the
            run and clean up.

        Parameters
        ----------
        events: ``int``, optional
            If provided, the daq will run for this many events before
            stopping, unless we override in `begin`.
            If not provided, we'll use the ``duration`` argument instead.
            Defaults to its last configured value, or ``None`` on the first
            configure.

        duration: ``int``, optional
            If provided, the daq will run for this many seconds before
            stopping, unless we override in `begin`.
            If not provided, and ``events`` was also not provided, an empty
            call like ``begin()`` will run indefinitely. You can also achieve
            this behavior by passing events=None and/or duration=None, Defaults
            to its last configured value, or ``None`` on the first configure.

        record: ``bool``, optional
            If ``True``, we'll record the data. If ``False``, we'll run without
            recording. If ``None``, we'll use the option selected in the DAQ
            GUI. Defaults to the its last configured value, or ``None`` on the
            first configure.

        use_l3t: ``bool``, optional
            If ``True``, an ``events`` argument to begin will be reinterpreted
            to only count events that pass the level 3 trigger. Defaults to
            its last configured value, or ``False`` on the first configure.

        controls: ``dict{name: device}`` or ``list[device...]``, optional
            If provided, values from these will make it into the DAQ data
            stream as variables. We will check ``device.position`` and
            ``device.value`` for quantities to use and we will update these
            values each time begin is called. To provide a list, all devices
            must have a ``name`` attribute. Defaults to its last configured
            value, or no controls values on the first configure.

        begin_sleep: ``int``, optional
            The amount of time to wait after the DAQ returns begin is done.
            This is a hack because the DAQ often says that a begin transition
            is done without actually being done, so it needs a short delay.
            Defaults to its last configured value, or 0 on the first
            configure.

        -------

        Determine the run number of the last run, or current run if running.

        This requires you to be on an NFS-mounted host. If hutch can be
        determined from the get_hutch_name script from engineering_tools, then
        you don't need to pass in a hutch name.

        This is a method and not a property because all properties are
        run when you try to tab complete, and this isn't necessarily an
        instant check. It can also display log messages, which would be
        annoying on tab complete.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hutch_name: ``str``, optional
            The hutch to check the run number for. If omitted, we'll guess

        Set up the l3t filters.

        These connect through pyami to call set_l3t or clear_l3t. The function
        takes in arbitrary dets whose prefixes are the ami names, along with
        low and highs.

        Event codes are handled as a special case, since you always want high
        vs low.

        .. note::
            If or_bykik is True, this will treat bykik at an l3t pass! This is
            so you don't lose your off shots when the l3t trigger is in veto
            mode.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args: (`AmiDet`, ``float``, ``float``) n times
            A sequence of (detector, low, high), which create filters that make
            sure the detector is between low and high. You can omit the first
            `AmiDet` as a shorthand for the current monitor, assuming a monitor
            has been set with `Daq.set_monitor` or `set_monitor_det`.

        event_codes: ``list``, optional
            A list of event codes to include in the filter. l3pass will be when
            the event code is present.

        operator: ``str``, optional
            The operator for combining the detector ranges and event codes.
            This can either be ``|`` to ``or`` the conditions together, so
            l3pass will happen if any filter passes, or it can be left at
            the default ``&`` to ``and`` the conditions together, so l3pass
            will only happen if all filters pass.

        or_bykik: ``bool``, optional
            False by default, appends an ``or`` condition that marks l3t pass
            when we see the bykik event code. This makes sure the off shots
            make it into the data if we're in l3t veto mode.
